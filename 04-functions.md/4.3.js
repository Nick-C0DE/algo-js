// By reusing the function rand10() created in Exercise 2, write a function named multiRand(n) that returns an array of n numbers between 1 and 10. You should not modify anything in rand10() to achieve this.

// Write a documentation for the multiRand(n) function.

// Use that function to create a program that will ask the number of random numbers to generate then display that same number of random numbers.
